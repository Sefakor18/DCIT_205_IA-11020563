1. This website is for the department of computer science. this is just to show where i have personally gotten to in terms of understanding how to apply html and css to build a website and how i can think and brainstorm on the spot in order to make my website look good and presentable. Its not perfect but I tried to incoperate everything i learnt in class and out.

5. First of all, I have learnt to brainstorm on the spot in how to design and make the website easy to read. I also learnt that getting a little help is not wrong and can actually help.I did not really understand how to do most of the stuff in html and css but as I kept going, it all started to make sense and how to do this to look like this, let me try and see if it also works this way, and it does. So the understanding of html and css has increased and improved more than when we started.
